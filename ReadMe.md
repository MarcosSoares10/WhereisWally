The algorithm was developed with Python 3.7.9, tensorflow 2.3.0 and OpenCV 3.4.2.

The TrainingSet folder contains the data used for training.

The TestSet folder contains the data used for testing.

The pretreinedmodels folder has the file generated by the network training to be used in the tests.

The results folder has a csv file that illustrates the results obtained, more specifically the name of the images and the coordinates of the centroides.

In addition, the results folder has a sub-folder called segmentedmasks which illustrates in images the areas segmented by the network for the generation of centroides present in the csv file.

The file with codes is called main.ipynb, it contains the entire process used to solve the test.

If you prefer to test, it is advisable to use only the last cell of this notebook as it is configured for testing with the pre-trained model.
